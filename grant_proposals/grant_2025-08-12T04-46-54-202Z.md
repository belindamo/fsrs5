**Project Title:**
Efficient Transformer Variants for Edge Deployment: Optimizing Performance and Resource Utilization

**Executive Summary:**
The proposed research aims to develop and evaluate efficient transformer model variants that are optimized for deployment on edge devices. By leveraging techniques such as model distillation and quantization, we aim to create models that are significantly smaller and require less computational power while maintaining high performance levels. This project will explore the trade-offs between model size, performance, and computational efficiency, with the goal of achieving a 10x reduction in model size and maintaining 95% of the original performance. The outcomes of this research have the potential to revolutionize the deployment of AI models in resource-constrained environments, enabling broader access to advanced AI technologies.

**Statement of Need:**
As AI models become increasingly complex, their deployment on edge devices is hindered by resource constraints. Current transformer models, while powerful, are often too large and computationally intensive for practical use in such environments. This research addresses the critical need for efficient AI models that can operate effectively on edge devices, thereby expanding the applicability of AI technologies in various fields, including healthcare, agriculture, and smart cities.

**Project Description:**
The project will focus on developing transformer variants that are optimized for edge deployment. We will employ model distillation and 8-bit quantization techniques to reduce model size and computational requirements. The research will involve a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of these models, including ablation studies on attention head scaling and comparisons with existing models like DistilBERT and TinyBERT.

**Literature Review:**
Recent advancements in transformer models, such as BERT and its variants, have demonstrated the potential for deep learning in natural language processing. However, these models are often too large for edge deployment. Previous studies have shown that model distillation and quantization can effectively reduce model size while maintaining performance, but further research is needed to optimize these techniques for transformer models.

**Research Design and Methods:**
The research will involve developing a series of transformer model variants using model distillation and quantization techniques. We will conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of these models, focusing on the trade-offs between model size, performance, and computational efficiency. Statistical analyses will be performed to determine the optimal number of attention heads and other model parameters.
